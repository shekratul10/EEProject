# 1st Year EE Project

Group 5/ASHB's Repository for the Electronics Design Project (Summer 2022)

**ATTENTION:** Try to avoid using inductors for circuits (excluding the air-cored inductor for radio wave detection) since they exhibit cataffi "undefined behaviour" when subjected to magnetic fields - we are detecting the presence of a magnetic field so it is possible that circuit with inductors to be affected. If you intend to use a second order filter, I suggest using a Sallen Key Filter/amplifier instead.

> Information for writing report on reed switch: https://uk.rs-online.com/web/generalDisplay.html?id=ideas-and-advice/reed-switches-guide. Order has been placed for two reed switches. [Data sheet attached] [Reed switch datasheet.pdf](https://github.com/shekratul10/EEProject/files/8786346/Reed.switch.datasheet.pdf) Just like a regular switch, activated by an external magnetic force -> can use a digital pin on the Adafruit and report true/false if a signal is received at the corresponding pin. Detects just the presence of a magnetic field detected from the rock. Since the polarity of the rock (one of the six) is not given, require two reed switches to detect north and south magnetic poles. May use two digital pins. Then use the data from the table above to determine the rocks correctly. We expect this to be complete within 1-2 days of the Reed switches being delivered. 

Circuit proposal: Have a 3.3 V supply voltage connected to a 10 kÎ© resistor connected in series with the Reed switch. Other end on the Reed switch is connected to a digital pin for processing. Code for testing: If <digitalPin> is high, return true (as a magnetic field is detected) otherwise return false. Note we need a circuit to detect if the magnetic field is up or down w.r.t. the rock.

- [ ] Upload the results to the web interface/app

> The acoustic signal transmitted from the rocks are both at 40 kHz, therefore we just need to design a circuit specific for this frequency and detect if it is present from the rock sample. Then use other properties of the rocks (IR and radio) to determine the rock sample being analysed.

- [x] Design circuit to detect IR pulse
- [x] Design circuit to amplify the IR pulse signal
- [ ] Analyse results from the circuit (determine the frequency of the pulse)
- [ ] Upload the results to the web interface/app

> The phototransistor is a light-controlled current source; we connect the phototransistor into Vcc and a load resistor and measure the voltage across the resistor. When measuring the IR pulse with the exorock shell, there is a **extremely** weak signal therefore we need to amplify the pulsed signal. Filtering may be required to remove the ambient IR that may interfere with the readings. We can then process the results using the digital pin on the Adafruit board and hopefully determine the frequency of the IR pulse and upload the results to the web interface/app. An existing soln. is to use an IR phototransistor SFH 309 FA. [IR phototransistor datasheet.pdf](https://github.com/shekratul10/EEProject/files/8786571/IR.phototransistor.datasheet.pdf) 

### Radio wave:
- [x] Create a suitable air-cored inductor
- [x] Test if the air-cored inductor can detect radio waves transmitted from the rock
- [ ] Design a suitable amplifier circuit to amplify the detected signal
- [ ] (1 of 2) Detect the carrier frequency of the signal (see below)*
- [ ] (2 of 2) Detect the modulating frequency of the signal (see below)
- [ ] Analyse the results from the carrier frequency circuit
- [ ] Analyse the results from the modulating frequency circuit
- [ ] Upload these results to the web interface/app
- [ ] Match the data to determine a suitable profile for the rock (if they emit radio signals)

Amplifying the circuit
> We need to significantly amplify the signal from picked up from the coil - even using a non-inverting amplifier with a gain of 1001, the output is not sufficiently amplified - the amplitude of the output waveform needs to be greater than the voltage drop from the diode else nothing will be detected at the output of the demodulator circuit. 

Detecting the carrier frequency (sinusoidal)
> We can apply filtering to the amplified signal to remove the extreme high-frequency noise and some low frequency background radiowaves. We can have a band-pass filter (low pass filter cascade with a high pass filter), where the corner frequencies are the frequency of the carrier signal (61 and 89 kHz). This can be implemented using first order filters, but if we use second order filters with a capacitor and an inductor, then we could use the resonant peak property to make the gain of the signal at the corner frequencies to be much higher than the other frequencies in the passband. From these increased signal peaks, we can analyse this using an analog input and determining the frequency of that input. A 4th order band-pass filter has been constructed and works, no processing has been done on these signals though.

Detecting the modulating frequency (square)
> We need to demodulate the amplified signal. Some lecture slides and pictures from the Signals and Communications lecture are shown below to aid the development of the rectifier detector. The modulating signal is a square wave, therefore we can analyse it using a digital pin on the Adafruit board.

### Resources
Number of pins used for sensors/analysis of signals: 4 Digital and 2 Analogue

### Design ideas
> Large wheels are better than the existing wheels that are provided with the EEE Bug. The wheels from the EE Bug are dogshit. Using larger wheels such as the ones that can be stolen from the robotic labs, are much better, provide additional height and look more heavy duty.

### Enhancing the durability of the EEE Rover  
Although we may have a functioning EEE Rover, we do not want it to break on the day of the oral so we should implement as many fail-safes as possible. For circuit analysing signals, use the shortest length wires as possible since this will minimise the amount of noise picked up in the signal and making the reading more accurate and consistent. Connections on the breadboard aren't the best so for each sensor circuit, perhaps build them on a separate board (I can't recall the name of the board but some of them are in the drawers at the entrance to the labs) and make the connections using soldering. Then we solder a wire from this board to the parent breadboard. We could use lower gauge wires for making connections between these sub-board to the breadboard to reduce the chances of the wires coming out of the breadboard slots. 
  
The chasis for the EEE Rover could wrap around the internal circuitry for functionality - this will protect the wires and components from dust and debris as well as restricting the movement of circuits and components and the EEE Rover moves. The chasis could include additonal mounting points for the breadboard and the sub-circuits so they can be secured into place and are less likely to come loose and rattle. 
  
Larger wheels will provide the EEE Rover with additional ground clearance, which can be useful when driving over smaller obstacles. The batteries for the EEE Bug are likely going to be on the bottom therefore we may need to consider making a protective plate that will prevent sharp objects from puncturing the batteries and preventing the EEE Rover from catching fire (as well as setting off the fire alarms). 
  
### Written report
Rough plan of what needs to be done for the written report:
  - [ ] Project Cover page
  - [ ] Table of contents/contents page for the written report
  - [ ] Information about the given problem as for context
  - [ ] Product specification
  - [ ] Gantt Chart (or equivalent planning roadmap)
  - [ ] Written reports for each section: magnetic sensor, IR sensor, radio sensor, acoustic sensor, web interface, motor control, CAD and other design changes etc.
  - [ ] Written report for integration of each sub-system with oneanother
  - [ ] Written report for test of functions
  - [ ] Assess the final product against the points given in the product specification
  - [ ] Evaluation of the project
  - [ ] References and sources at the end of the document with the appropriate referencing

  For specialist written report, there should be a similar structure between each
  - [ ] Heading for what section the report is about
  - [ ] Introduction to the problem given e.g. for magnetic we want to detect the presence of a magnetic field from an unknown rock sample
  - [ ] Suggest a soln. to the given problem with the help of the given sensor/component used
  - [ ] Background information about the component e.g. for magnetic we have gone for reed switch and a website has been included describing the workings of the reed switch (make sure to reference appropriately)
  - [ ] Suggest a suitable circuit and signal processing techniques to solve the problem e.g. for magnetic use a reed switch to send a voltage to a digital pin on the Adafruit board, where we can assess whether a magnetic field is detected with the use of boolean variables
  - [ ] Testing of the circuit and well as appropriate results e.g. for radio wave we can have oscilloscopes in labs detect the signal picked up by the air-cored inductor
  - [ ] Refinements and improvements to the circuit to improve performance and reliability, once again have appropriate results to show progression
  - [ ] For signal processing, whether done on Adafruit or elsewhere, explain what code does e.g. for IR pulse have an algorithm that determines the frequency of the pulsed signal and explain the parts of the code that allows us to determine the frequency
  - [ ] Testing of the overall system with pictures and diagrams to help explain the results and show that the implementation functions as intended. 
  - [ ] Have a final circuit schematic included in the document where necessary, where values of the components used e.g. a resistor used in reed switch circuit has a value of 10 kÎ© or something similar
  - [ ] Referencing for research, concepts, similar circuits and code examples at the end of the specialist written report. This should be easy for the editor of the written report to find the references and merge all references across all of the written reports at the end of the document.
  
### Gantt chart
  This is a chart that shows what tasks need to be done during a project, including the time it should be start as well as the time it should be finished by. This can be done easily in Mircosoft Excel, but other software can be used for making this chart. This will allow us to represent the planning stages of the project in the written report as well as use it to determine when deadlines should be met and which tasks we should prioritise for completion. 
  
### Product Specification
  The talk was pretty shit. Essentially we, as a group, must come up with a set of criteria that our finished EEE Rover must satisfy in order for it to be successful. Each point needs to be concise and relevant to the project. These goals are what we will be working towards throughout the duration of the project. These goals are not fixed; they provide a baseline of what we need to accomplish in the project but we can change any of the product specification points if needed if we find out a point is not concise enough or not providing the restrictions we require. This will be useful in the evaluation of the project since we can look back our product specification and determine if our final product satisfy our points, which will determine whether the project was successful or not. The journey is worth more than the end product so don't change the product specification just to satisfy the objective that couldn't be achieved with the old point(s). That is the purpose of an evaluation.
