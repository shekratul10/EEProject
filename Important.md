> Information for writing report on reed switch: https://uk.rs-online.com/web/generalDisplay.html?id=ideas-and-advice/reed-switches-guide. Order has been placed for two reed switches (currently pending)[Data sheet attached] [Reed switch datasheet.pdf](https://github.com/shekratul10/EEProject/files/8786346/Reed.switch.datasheet.pdf)Just like a regular switch, activated by an external magnetic force -> can use a digital pin on the Adafruit and report true/false if a signal is received at the corresponding pin. Detects just the presence of a magnetic field detected from the rock. Since the polarity of the rock (one of the six) is not given, require two reed switches to detect north and south magnetic poles. May use two digital pins. Then use the data from the table above to determine the rocks correctly.

- [ ] Analyse results from the circuit
- [ ] Upload the results to the web interface/app

Infrared:
- [x] Determine a suitable soln. to detect Infrared pulses
- [x] Determine a suitable sensor to detect Infrared pulses
- [x] Place order for the chosen sensor
- [x] Approve order for the chosen sensor
