### Design ideas
> Large wheels are better than the existing wheels that are provided with the EEE Bug. The wheels from the EE Bug are dogshit. Using larger wheels such as the ones that can be stolen from the robotic labs, are much better, provide additional height and look more heavy duty.

### Enhancing the durability of the EEE Rover  
Although we may have a functioning EEE Rover, we do not want it to break on the day of the oral so we should implement as many fail-safes as possible. For circuit analysing signals, use the shortest length wires as possible since this will minimise the amount of noise picked up in the signal and making the reading more accurate and consistent. Connections on the breadboard aren't the best so for each sensor circuit, perhaps build them on a separate board (I can't recall the name of the board but some of them are in the drawers at the entrance to the labs) and make the connections using soldering. Then we solder a wire from this board to the parent breadboard. We could use lower gauge wires for making connections between these sub-board to the breadboard to reduce the chances of the wires coming out of the breadboard slots. 
  
The chasis for the EEE Rover could wrap around the internal circuitry for functionality - this will protect the wires and components from dust and debris as well as restricting the movement of circuits and components and the EEE Rover moves. The chasis could include additonal mounting points for the breadboard and the sub-circuits so they can be secured into place and are less likely to come loose and rattle. 
  
Larger wheels will provide the EEE Rover with additional ground clearance, which can be useful when driving over smaller obstacles. The batteries for the EEE Bug are likely going to be on the bottom therefore we may need to consider making a protective plate that will prevent sharp objects from puncturing the batteries and preventing the EEE Rover from catching fire (as well as setting off the fire alarms). 
  
### Product Specification
  The talk was pretty shit. Essentially we, as a group, must come up with a set of criteria that our finished EEE Rover must satisfy in order for it to be successful. Each point needs to be concise and relevant to the project. These goals are what we will be working towards throughout the duration of the project. These goals are not fixed; they provide a baseline of what we need to accomplish in the project but we can change any of the product specification points if needed if we find out a point is not concise enough or not providing the restrictions we require. This will be useful in the evaluation of the project since we can look back our product specification and determine if our final product satisfy our points, which will determine whether the project was successful or not. The journey is worth more than the end product so don't change the product specification just to satisfy the objective that couldn't be achieved with the old point(s). That is the purpose of an evaluation.
