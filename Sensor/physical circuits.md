All sensor circuits should be built on stripboards since the connections are more secure, stripboards are better use for space, smaller, thinner and lighter than breadboards. Additional advantages in the written report and a useful website on how to use stripboards can be found in the references (Ref 6).

There are several circuits that have been soldered to the stripboards such as the infrared and ultrasound sensing circuits. These circuits work as intended with Vcc, GND and signal wires as actual wire components. The length of the wires can be changed either by cutting them to size or replacing them with wires of appropriate size. The Vcc and GND wires will be soldered to another stripboard that will act as a power distributor board, featuring rails for 3.3 V, 5 V and GND, which will have connections to the breadboard.
