Information for writing report on reed switch: https://uk.rs-online.com/web/generalDisplay.html?id=ideas-and-advice/reed-switches-guide. Order has been placed for two reed switches (currently pending)[Data sheet attached]
> [Reed switch datasheet.pdf](https://github.com/shekratul10/EEProject/files/8786346/Reed.switch.datasheet.pdf)
Just like a regular switch, activated by an external magnetic force -> can use a digital pin on the Adafruit and report true/false if a signal is received at the corresponding pin. Detects just the presence of a magnetic field detected from the rock. Since the polarity of the rock (one of the six) is not given, require two reed switches to detect north and south magnetic poles. May use two digital pins. Then use the data from the table below






Need to order the ultrasonic module
