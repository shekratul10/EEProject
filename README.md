# Group 5/ASHB's EE Project 2022 

All important information is here:

**Here is a Gantt chart, which shows what section of the project should be complete for a set date so we can meet the project deadline ontime (19 June 2022)**

The following needs to be **accomplished** to meet our project goals:
- [ ] Develop a circuit to detect acoustic signals and analyse the frequency
- [x] Develop a circuit to detect infrared pulses and analyse the pulse frequency
- [ ] Develop a circuit to detect magnetic field polarity and analyse the direction of the field
- [ ] Develop a circuit to detect radio waves, detect the carrier frequency, detect the modulating frequency and analyse these frequencies
- [ ] Establish motor control of the EEE Rover
- [ ] Establish a web interface to control the motion of the EEE Rover as well as display the data gathered from the sensors
- [ ] Consider CAD-based methods to improve the design of the EEE Rover
- [ ] Conduct testing for each sensor and motor control
- [ ] Produce a written report for each section, combine the reports and edit the combined document
- [ ] Review the combined written report for final adjustments
- [ ] Submit the final written report

Here are some suggestions to make writing the written report easier
- We are required to reference using the IEEE standard, which is similar to Vancouver style referencing, this document provides an extensive guide on how to use this type of referencing: [Vancouver_condensed_guide_2020.pdf](https://github.com/shekratul10/EEProject/files/8809458/Vancouver_condensed_guide_2020.pdf)
- **Record all** (circuit) design ideas and changes as this will make the written report easier as you show refinements to your design.
- **Backup** your written report either by onedrive or outlook!
- Use the heading formatting in word since this will make it easier to navigate through the whole report and makes it easier for combining the individual reports together.
