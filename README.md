## Important 
- Make component orders at https://apps.powerapps.com/play/30b4e212-d040-4203-98cc-882acb4edee0?tenantId=2b897507-ee8c-4575-830b-4f8267c3d307 if necessary
- **We should wear suits or other formal wear to the demo for 24/06/22**
- Be aware that digital pins 5,7 & 10 cannot be used on the Adafruit board

The following needs to be **accomplished** to meet our project goals:
- [x] Develop a circuit to detect acoustic signals and analyse the frequency
- [x] Develop a circuit to detect infrared pulses and analyse the pulse frequency
- [x] Develop a circuit to detect magnetic field polarity and analyse the direction of the field
- [x] Develop a circuit to detect radio waves, detect the carrier frequency, detect the modulating frequency and analyse these frequencies
- [x] Establish motor control of the EEE Rover
- [x] Establish a web interface to control the motion of the EEE Rover as well as display the data gathered from the sensors
- [x] Consider CAD-based methods to improve the design of the EEE Rover
- [x] Conduct testing for each sensor and motor control
- [x] Produce a written report for each section, combine the reports and edit the combined document
- [x] Review the combined written report for final adjustments
- [x] Submit the final written report
