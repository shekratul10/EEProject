For project information read "Important.md"

Submit code for sensor/motor control here using upload file prompt so that Damani can upload to the web interface

Gantt chart for the project shows the expected start times and deadlines for each task in order to deliver a completed project on time.

You should do the following:
- [ ] Read important.md daily and feel free to add information that may help others complete their dedicated tasks
- [ ] Attempt to make progress every day since this is required to meet the deadline
- [ ] Record all design ideas, design changes and results for the written report of your section
- [ ] Be willing to explain your part of the project to other group members so they have a better understanding on what you've done and why for the oral on the 24th June 2022
- [ ] Include any relevant pictures, diagrams and calculations in your written report
- [ ] Submit the code for your sensor here since Damani is working very hard on the web interface
- [ ] Come into the lab for atleast 3 times a week - this ensures progress on the project is being made and helps us to meet our deadline
- [ ] For written reports, do not include headers since they will be different for the final report. A footer may be used, which shows the table contents
- [ ] Use the headings text formatting in word for all sections of your report since this will make the contents page easier to make in the final report. Also it will be easier for the editor to turn the report from several authors into a single author
- [ ] Include referencing for all information, ideas, circuit diagrams and datasheets used - the plagiarism checker will always flag something even though what you've written may be your own words and/or work however it is best to be safe rather than have the whole group suffer
- [ ] Order the necessary components on Teams and Damani will approve of the order - they will take up to a week to be delivered so order asap and don't leave it to the last minute

**Notes for Damani**
- [ ] Steal some beefy wheels from the robotics lab in EE Building
- [ ] Bring in the Ultrasonic sensors in for Tuesday 31th May 2022
- [ ] Take a well deserved rest
