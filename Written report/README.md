# Please submit your specialist written reports here

This will feature a rough template of what the final written report should feature.
- Project cover page
- Table of contents/contents page
- Information about the given problem (for context)
- Product specification
- Gantt chart
- Written reports for each section (sensors, motor control, web interface, CAD, etc.)
- Integration of the individual written reports (formatting etc.)
- Written report for testing the functions on the complete EEE Rover
- Evaluation of the complete EEE Rover against the points in the product specification
- Project evaluation
- References and sources using the Vancouver referencing.

Here are some suggestions to make writing your written report easier:
- We are required to reference sources using the IEEE standard, which is similar to Vancouver style referencing. Please make yourself familiar with it; this document provides an extensive guide on how to use this type of referencing: [Vancouver_condensed_guide_2020.pdf](https://github.com/shekratul10/EEProject/files/8809625/Vancouver_condensed_guide_2020.pdf)
- **Record all** (circuit) design ideas and changes as this will make the written report easier as you show refinements to your design.
- **Backup** your written report either by onedrive, github or outlook!
- Use heading formatting in word since this will make it easier to navigate through the whole report and makes it easier for combining the individual reports together
